# Final steps before the run

Before going further, please make sure to refer to this [section](../composition.md) as the following commands could defer depending your setup.

## Get the `ovos-docker` sources

The `~/hivemind` directory is only required if you plan to use [HiveMind](../../../about/glossary/terms.md#hivemind).

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker.git -b dev
  mkdir -p ~/ovos/{config,share,tmp} ~/hivemind/{config,share}
  chown ${USER}:${USER} -R ~/ovos ~/hivemind
  cd ~/ovos-docker/compose
  ```

## Enable user manager

Because some containers require `/run/user/1000` to be mounted, [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) should be instruct to log the user during the boot process and mak`/run/user/1000` directory available before the containers start.

=== "Raspberry Pi"

    ```shell
    sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```shell
    sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
    ```

## Set the environment file

The `composer` requires an environment file in order to deploy the services and volumes with the correct settings for your setup.

!!! info "`alpha` version by default"
