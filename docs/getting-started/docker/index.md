# Docker or Podman

Before going further, here are quick and simple definitions of what a container is and what a `composer` is, these definitions are important and must be well understood before starting.

!!! info "Two engines, same definition"

    Both of the definitions described below are valid for either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/). :thumbsup:

## Container definition

> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application.

## Composer definition

> A composer is a tool for defining and running multi-container container applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
