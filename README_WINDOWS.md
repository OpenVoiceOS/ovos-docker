## Limitations

Because Open Voice OS was designed to run on Linux operating system, some limitations exist on Windows.

*   Open Voice OS GUI is not available
*   DBus is not yet supported which prevent the use of MPRIS via the `ovos_audio` container
*   Some plugins with PHAL will/could be limited to what WSL2 supports

## Requirements

### Docker

Docker Desktop is required in order to provide the container engine to WSL2. For more information about Docker Desktop, please visit <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>.

Once installed and started, run the following command to ensure that Docker engine is up and running.

```bash
docker system info
```

*Docker Desktop doesn't start by default when Windows boots up. You must have Docker Desktop running in Windows before WSL2 can use Docker.*

### PulseAudio

PulseAudio is available via WSLG, which runs in a separate VM. You must be on a recent version of WSL2 that provides WSLG.

You may need to install `pulseaudio` in your WSL environment. With Ubuntu, for example:

```bash
sudo apt install -y pulseaudio
```

The ultimate test will be to run a Docker container and waiting for the sounds to be played.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.config/pulse:/home/pulseaudio/.config/pulse keinos/speaker-test
```

If successful you should hear test sounds from left and right speakers and see this output:

```text
