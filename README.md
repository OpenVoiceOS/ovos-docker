## What is Open Voice OS?

[![Open Voice OS logo](https://openvoiceos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ovos-egg.png)](https://openvoiceos.org/)

[Open Voice OS](https://openvoiceos.org/) is a community-driven, open-source voice AI platform for creating custom voice-controlled interfaces across devices with NLP, a customizable UI, and a focus on privacy and security.

More information about Open Voice OS genesis [here](https://openvoiceos.org/a-brief-history-of-open-voice-os/).

## How does it work with Docker or Podman?

Open Voice OS is a complex piece of software which has several core components. These core components have been split into containers to provide a better isolation and a microservice approach.

| Container                | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---                      | ---                                                                                                                            |
| `ovos_messagebus`        | Message bus service provides a websocket where all internal events travel, the nervous system of Open Voice OS                 |
| `ovos_phal`              | PHAL is the Platform Hardware Abstraction Layer, it completely replaces the concept of hardcoded enclosure from `mycroft-core` |
| `ovos_phal_admin`        | This service is intended for handling any OS-level interactions requiring escalation of privileges                             |
| `ovos_audio`             | The audio service handles playback and queueing of tracks                                                                      |
| `ovos_listener`          | The speech client is responsible for loading STT, VAD and Wake Word plugins                                                    |
| `ovos_core`              | The core service is responsible for loading skills and intent parsers                                                          |
| `ovos_cli`               | Command line for Open Voice OS                                                                                                 |
| `ovos_gui_websocket`     | Websocket process to handle messages for the Open Voice OS GUI                                                                 |
| `ovos_gui`               | Open Voice OS graphical user interface                                                                                         |
| `ovos_hivemind_listener` | The HiveMind listener handles the authenticated connections using the secured protocol                                         |
| `ovos_hivemind_cli`      | Command line to interact with HiveMind                                                                                         |

To allow data persistence, Docker or Podman volumes are required which will prevent downloading the requirements everytime the containers are re-created.

| Volume                  | Description                                      |
| ---                     | ---                                              |
| `ovos_listener_records` | Wake word and utterance records                  |
| `ovos_models`           | Models downloaded by `precise-lite`              |
| `ovos_nltk`             | Punkt package required by NLTK                   |
| `ovos_vosk`             | Data downloaded by VOSK during the initial boot  |

`ovos_listener_records` will allow you to retrieve recorded wake words which could help you to build or improve models. By default, the recording features are disabled, `"record_wake_words": true` and `"save_utterances": true` will have to be added to the `listener` section of `mycroft.conf` to enable these capabilities.

## Requirements

For Mac OS users, please follow this [requirements](README_MACOS.md) before going further.

For Windows users, please follow these [requirements](README_WINDOWS.md) before going further.

### Docker or Podman

Docker or Podman *(rootless)* is of course required and `docker compose` *(not `docker-compose`!!)* or `podman-compose` is a nice to have to simplify the whole process of deploying the whole stack by using the `docker-compose.yml` files *(for Docker, this command will be embedded depending the version, for Podman, `podman-compose` command comes from a different package)*.

This is what looks like the container creation via `podman run` *(it will be very similar with Docker)* command for one container only *(when not using `podman-compose`)*.

*Do not try to run the command below, this is just an example!*

```bash
podman run \
  --name=ovos_listener \
  -d \
  --requires=ovos_messagebus,ovos_phal \
  --security-opt label=disable \
  --label io.podman.compose.config-hash=056f36a6c3697f2c85d5165a67732ddbf9e3932633430783a597037805f268ff \
  --label io.podman.compose.project=ovos-docker \
  --label io.podman.compose.version=1.0.6 \
  --label PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=podman-compose@ovos-docker.service \
  --label com.docker.compose.project=ovos-docker \
  --label com.docker.compose.project.working_dir=/home/goldyfruit/Development/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker \
  --label com.docker.compose.project.config_files=docker-compose.yml,docker-compose.skills.yml \
  --label com.docker.compose.container-number=1 \
  --label com.docker.compose.service=ovos_listener \
  --device /dev/snd \
  -e PULSE_SERVER=unix:/run/user/1000/pulse/native \
  -e PULSE_COOKIE=/home/ovos/.config/pulse/cookie \
  -e TZ=America/Montreal \
  -v /home/goldyfruit/.config/pulse/cookie:/home/ovos/.config/pulse/cookie:ro \
  -v /home/goldyfruit/ovos/config:/home/ovos/.config/mycroft:ro \
  -v ovos_listener_records:/home/ovos/.local/share/mycroft/listener \
  -v ovos_models:/home/ovos/.local/share/precise-lite \
  -v ovos_vosk:/home/ovos/.local/share/vosk \
  -v /home/goldyfruit/ovos/tmp:/tmp/mycroft \
  -v /run/user/1000/pulse:/run/user/1000/pulse:ro \
  --network host \
  --userns keep-id \
  --hostname ovos_listener \
  --pull always \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  docker.io/smartgic/ovos-listener:alpha
```

:warning: You should not run `docker compose` as `root` or using `sudo` command, if so then you will get some error message such as `Permission denied:` and some containers could restart in a loop. To allow a simple user to execute the `docker` command, make sure to add the user to the `docker` group.

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

Once added, logout from the current session *(graphical or SSH)*.

### PulseAudio

PulseAudio is a requirement and has to be up and running on the host to expose a socket *(for communication)* and a cookie *(for authentication)* to allow the containers to have access to the microphone and speakers.

On modern Linux distribution, Pipewire handles the sound stack on the system, making sure PulseAudio support is enabled within PipeWire and the service is started as a user and not as `root`. The user running the containers must be part of the `audio` system group *(depending the Linux distribution)*.

The `pactl info` command should return information without any error or connection refused. Remember to check the permissions of `~/.config/pulse` and `/run/user/1000` directories as well, they should belong to the user running the stack, not `root`.

### CPU instruction for TensorFlow

In order to run TensorFlow, the CPU must support `AVX` *(Advanced Vector Extensions)* instruction set for x86 processor or `SIMD` *(Single Instruction, Multiple Data)* instruction set for ARM processor.

To validate if the instruction is available, run the following command:

```bash
egrep "avx|simd" /proc/cpuinfo
```

If the command returns no output then your CPU doesn't fit the requirements for TensorFlow. *It does not mean that Open Voice OS can't run on your hardware, it simply means that Precise wake word engine will not run on it.*

## How to build these images

The `base` image is the main layer for the other images, for example the `messagebus` image requires the `base` image to be built. The `sound-base` image is based on the `base` image as well but it's role is dedicated to images that requires sound capabilities such as `audio`, `listener`, `phal`, *etc...*

**Since there is not yet any stable Open Voice OS release compatible with the current container architecture, the `--build-arg ALPHA=true` is "mandatory" to build working images *(except the `ovos-gui` and `ovos-bus-server` images)*.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker.git
cd ovos-docker
docker buildx build base/ -t smartgic/ovos-base:alpha --build-arg ALPHA=true --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') --no-cache
docker buildx build gui/ -t smartgic/ovos-gui:alpha --build-arg BRANCH_OVOS=master --build-arg BRANCH_MYCROFT=stable-qt5 --no-cache
  # Or:
podman buildx build base/ -t smartgic/ovos-base:alpha --build-arg ALPHA=true --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ') --no-cache
podman buildx build gui/ -t smartgic/ovos-gui:alpha --build-arg BRANCH_OVOS=master --build-arg BRANCH_MYCROFT=stable-qt5 --no-cache
```

### Arguments

There are a list of arguments available that could be used during the image build process.

| Name             | Value                              | Default      | Description                                                       |
| ---              | ---                                | ---          | ---                                                               |
| `ALPHA`          | `true`                             | `false`      | Using the alpha releases from PyPi built from the `dev` branches  |
| `BUILD_DATE`     | `$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')` | `unknown`    | Used as `LABEL` within the Dockerfile to determine the build date |
| `BRANCH_OVOS`    | `master`                           | `master`     | Branch of `ovos-shell`Git  repository                             |
| `BRANCH_MYCROFT` | `stable-qt5`                       | `stable-qt5` | Branch of `mycroft-gui` Git repository                            |
| `TAG`            | `alpha`                            | `alpha`      | OCI image tag, (e.g. `docker pull smartgic/ovos-base:alpha`)      |
| `VERSION`        | `0.0.8a`                           | `unknown`    | Used as `LABEL` within the Dockerfile to determine the version    |

### Image alternatives

Open Voice OS provides two *(2)* different implementations for the message bus.

#### Message bus

- `ovos-messagebus` image which is a Python implementation *(default)*
- `ovos-bus-server` image which is a C++ implementation *(better performances but lack of configuration as it doesn't support `mycroft.conf` yet)*

**Only one implementation can be selected at a time.**

Twelve *(12)* images needs to be build; `ovos-base`, `ovos-listener-dinkum`, `ovos-core`, `ovos-cli`, `ovos-messagebus` or `ovos-bus-server`, `ovos-phal`, `ovos-phal-admin`, `ovos-sound-base`, `ovos-audio`, `ovos-gui` and `ovos-gui-websocket`.

Pre-build images are already available [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/smartgic) and are the default referenced with the `docker-compose.*.yml` files.

## How to use these images

`docker-compose.yml` files provides an easy way to provision the container stack *(volumes and services)* with the required configuration for each of them. `docker compose` or `podman-compose` both support environment files, check the `.env` *(`.env-raspberrypi` for Raspberry Pi)* file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker.git
mkdir -p ~/ovos/{config,local,share,tmp} ~/hivemind/{config,share}
chown ${USER}:${USER} -R ~/ovos ~/hivemind
cd ~/ovos-docker/compose
docker compose --project-name ovos up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose --project-name ovos up -d
```

To reduce the potential overhead due to the image downloads and extracts, the `--parallel` option could be user in order to process the images by batch of `x` *(where `x` is an integer)*.

```bash
docker compose --project-name ovos --parallel 3 pull
docker compose --project-name ovos up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose --project-name ovos --parallel 3 pull
podman-compose --project-name ovos up -d
```

By default, `docker compose` or `podman-compose` will look for a `docker-compose.yml` and an `.env` file, but more files could be added to the command to extend the services configuration. **`podman-compose` supports for now only one environment file.**

When passing the `docker-compose.gui.yml` file to the compose command, the voice assistant will not be **headless** anymore which means that a GUI *(Graphical user Interface)* will be available. For more details about the GUI please go to [this section](#open-voice-os-gui).

```bash
docker compose --project-name ovos -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gui.yml -f docker-compose.raspberrypi.yml -f docker-compose.raspberrypi.gui.yml --env-file .env-raspberrypi up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose --project-name ovos -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gui.yml -f docker-compose.raspberrypi.yml -f docker-compose.raspberrypi.gui.yml --env-file .env-raspberrypi up -d
```

For Mac OS users, the file to pass to `docker compose` or `podman-compose` is `docker-compose.macos.yml`; there is no specific environment variable file.

```bash
docker compose --project-name ovos -f docker-compose.macos.yml --env-file .env up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose --project-name ovos -f docker-compose.macos.yml --env-file .env up -d
```

For Windows users, the file to pass to `docker compose` is `docker-compose.windows.yml`; there is no specific environment variable file.

```bash
docker compose --project-name ovos -f docker-compose.windows.yml --env-file .env up -d
```

Some variables might need to be tuned to match your setup such as the timezone, the directories, *etc...*, have a look into the `.env` and `.env-raspberrypi` files before running `docker compose` or `podman-compose`.

The `OVOS_USER` variable should be changed **only** if you build the Docker images with a different user than `ovos`.

By default the services will write the logs into a log file under `.local` directory, these files are not rotated which could lead to disk space issue. The solution is to add these lines into `~/ovos/config/mycroft.conf`, this will tell the services to not create a log file but redirect the logs to the container stdout.

```json
{
  "logs": {
    "path": "stdout"
  }
}
```

## How to update the current stack

The easiest way to update a stack already deployed by `docker compose` or `podman-compose` is to use `docker compose` or `podman-compose`. :relaxed:

Because the `pull_policy` option of each service is set to `always`, everytime that a new image is uploaded with the same tag then `docker compose` or `podman-compose` will pull-it and re-create the container based on this new image.

```bash
docker compose up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose up -d
```

If you want to change the tag to deploy, update the `.env` file with the new value.

## Skills management

There are two *(2)* different ways to install an Open Voice OS skill, each having pros and cons.

### Skill running inside ovos-core container

The first way is to use the `skills.list` file within the `~/ovos/config/` directory, this file acts as a Python `requirements.txt` file. When the `ovos_core` container starts, it will look for this file and install the skills defined in there. These skills have to be compatible with the `pip install` method which requires a `setup.py` file.

```ini
ovos-skill-volume==0.0.1 # Specific skill version on PyPi
ovos-skill-stop # Latest skill version on PyPi
git+https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/skill-ovos-wikipedia.git@fix/whatever # Specific branch of a skill on GitHub
```

If the `ovos-core` container is wiped for any reason, the skill(s) will be reinstalled automatically but the skill configurations will not be erased.

The main advantage is the simplicity, but the downside will be more Python dependencies *(libraries)* within the `ovos-core` container and potential conflicts across them.

### Skill running as standalone container

The second way is to leverage the `ovos-workshop` component by running a skill as standalone. This means the skill will not be part of `ovos-core` container but it will be running inside its own container.

The advantage is that each skill are isolated which provide more flexibility about Python libraries, packages, *etc...* and more security but the downside will be that more system resources will be consumed and a container image has to be built.

Few skills are already available on [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/smartgic) as well as a `docker-compose.skills.yml` file. Run the following command to install the pre-build containers.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.skills.yml up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.skills.yml up -d
```

If the `ovos_core` container is deleted, the skill will remain available until the `ovos_core` container comes back.

## TTS (Text-to-Speech) and STT (Speech-to-Text)

### TTS

The `ovos_audio` container comes with few TTS plugins such as:

- `ovos-tts-plugin-mimic` is the original Mycroft AI Text-to-Speech with the iconic Alan Pope's voice sample
- `ovos-tts-plugin-mimic2` is the cloud based version hosted on Mycroft AI infrastructure
- `ovos-tts-plugin-mimic3-server` is the latest Mycroft AI Text-to-Speech engine
- `ovos-tts-plugin-server` is a companion plugin that allows you to reach an external TTS service

If the existing TTS plugins are not enough then you can install yours by following the same principle as for the skills by adding a `tts.list` file within the `~/ovos/config/` directory, this file acts as a Python `requirements.txt` file. When the `ovos_audio` container starts, it will look for this file and install the skills defined in there. These skills have to be compatible with the `pip install` method which requires a `setup.py` file.

```ini
ovos-tts-plugin-marytts==0.0.1a1 # Specific plugin version on PyPi
neon-tts-plugin-mozilla-remote # Latest plugin version on PyPi
git+https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/neon-tts-plugin-polly.git@fix/whatever # Specific branch of a plugin on GitHub
```

The `ovos_audio` container must be restarted if a change occurs in the `tts.list` file.

### STT

The `ovos_listener` container comes with few STT plugins such as:

- `ovos-stt-plugin-server` is a companion plugin that allows you to reach an external STT service
- `ovos-stt-plugin-vosk` is an offline STT service

If the existing STT plugins are not enough then you can install yours by following the same principle as for the STT plugins *(from above)* by adding a `stt.list` file within the `~/ovos/config/` directory, this file acts as a Python `requirements.txt` file. When the `ovos_listener` container starts, it will look for this file and install the skills defined in there. These skills have to be compatible with the `pip install` method which requires a `setup.py` file.

```ini
ovos-stt-plugin-vosk==0.2.0a1 # Specific plugin version on PyPi
ovos-stt-plugin-server # Latest plugin version on PyPi
git+https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-stt-plugin-chromium.git@fix/whatever # Specific branch of a plugin on GitHub
```

The `ovos_listener` container must be restarted if a change occurs in the `stt.list` file.

## PHAL plugins

The `ovos_phal` and `ovos_phal_admin` containers work with plugins. In order to install a plugin into either one of these two containers, the `phal.list` and/or `phal_admin.list` will have to be populated with the wanted plugins.

```ini
ovos-phal-plugin-ipgeo==0.0.1 # Specific plugin version on PyPi
ovos-PHAL-plugin-alsa # Latest plugin version on PyPi
git+https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-PHAL-plugin-homeassistant.git@fix/whatever # Specific branch of a plugin on GitHub
```

The `ovos_phal` and/or `ovos_phal_admin` containers must be restarted if a change occurs into the `phal.list` and/or `phal_admin.list` files.

## Open Voice OS CLI

The command line allows a user to send a message directly but not only to the bus by using the `ovos-cli-client` command.

```bash
docker exec -ti ovos_cli ovos-cli-client
  # Or:
podman exec -ti ovos_cli ovos-cli-client
```

To display or manage the current configuration, the `ovos-config` command could be used.

```bash
docker exec -ti ovos_cli ovos-config show
  # Or:
podman exec -ti ovos_cli ovos-config show
```

`vim` and `nano` editors are available within the `ovos-cli` image, `vim` has been set as default.

An easy way to make Open Voice OS speak is to run the `ovos-speak` command.

```bash
docker exec -ti ovos_cli ovos-speak "hello world"
  # Or:
podman exec -ti ovos_cli ovos-speak "hello world"
```

## Open Voice OS GUI

:mega: The Open Voice OS GUI is available with the Open Voice OS Shell layer on top of it. **This container still under some development** mostly because of the skill's QML files are not been shared between `ovos_gui` container and `ovos_skill_*` containers.

In order to allow only the `ovos_gui` container to access to the X server, you will have to allow the container to connect to X.

```bash
xhost +local:ovos_gui
```

This command is not permanent, when your operating system will reboot, you will have to run the command again.

`xhost` is part of the `x11-xserver-utils` package on Debian based distributions.

## Security and HiveMind

By default, the message bus is listening on `0.0.0.0` port `8181`, this could be a security issue as a device could connect to the message bus and send/read messages. To prevent potential security issues, it is recommended to use a firewall on port `8181`.

`iptables` will be demonstrated as an example but if `firewalld` or `ufw` services are used, then make sure to be compliant with your distribution/operating system.

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s localhost --dport 8181 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8181 -j DROP
```

This will allow connections to port `8181` **only** from localhost **(internal)**.

### HiveMind to the rescue

What is HiveMind *(from the [official documentation](https://jarbashivemind.github.io/HiveMind-community-docs/))*?

> HiveMind is a community-developed superset or extension of OpenVoiceOS, the open-source voice operating system.
>
> With HiveMind, you can extend one (or more, but usually just one!) instance of OpenVoiceOS to as many devices as you want, including devices that can't ordinarily run OpenVoiceOS!

What it mean is that HiveMind allows external connections to the message bus by using a secured protocol.

A `docker-compose.hivemind.yml` file is available in order to deploy `ovos_hivemind_listener` and `ovos_hivemind_cli` containers.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/hivemind/{config,share}
chown ${USER}:${USER} -R ~/hivemind
cd ~/ovos-docker/compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.hivemind.yml up -d
  # Or:
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.hivemind.yml up -d
```

Once the HiveMind containers are up and running, the HiveMind command line allows you to add client, list client, delete client, etc...

```bash
docker exec -it ovos_hivemind_cli hivemind-core --help
  # Or:
podman exec -it ovos_hivemind_cli hivemind-core --help
```

For more information about how to authenticate, please read [HiveMind-core readme](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/HiveMind-core).

## Debug

:warning: The commands below are not *steps*, they don't have to be followed in the same order as they are presented!

Enable debug mode in `~/ovos/config/mycroft.conf` to get more verbosity from the logs. All containers will have to be restarted to receive the configuration change.

```json
{
  "debug": true,
  "log_level": "DEBUG",
  "logs": {
    "path": "stdout"
  }
}
```

To access all the container logs at the same time, run the following command *(make sure it matches the `docker compose` or `podman-compose` command you run to deploy the stack)*:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.raspberrypi.yml -f docker-compose.skills.yml --env-file .env --env-file .env-raspberrypi logs -f --tail 200
  # Or:
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.raspberrypi.yml -f docker-compose.skills.yml --env-file .env --env-file .env-raspberrypi logs -n -f --tail 200
```

To access the logs of a specific container, run the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f --tail 200 ovos_audio
  # Or:
podman logs -f --tail 200 ovos_audio
```

To execute a command inside a container without going into it, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -ti ovos_audio pactl info
  # Or:
podman exec -ti ovos_audio pactl info
```

To go inside a container and run multiple commands, run the following command *(where `sh` is the available shell in there)*:

```bash
docker exec -ti ovos_audio sh
  # Or:
podman exec -ti ovos_audio sh
```

Make sure the `mycroft.conf` configuration file is JSON valid by using the `jq` command.

```bash
cat ~/ovos/config/mycroft.conf | jq
```

If the configuration file is not valid JSON, `jq` will return something like this:

```text
parse error: Expected another key-value pair at line 81, column 3
```

To get the CPU, memory and I/O consumption per container, run the following command:

```bash
docker stats -a --no-trunc
  # Or:
podman stats -a --no-trunc
```
